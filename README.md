# Python Solutions for Cracking the Coding Interview

This is a collection of solutions that I am posting as I work through the 6th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview

## Format

I have done my best to conform to a strict standard of documenting my thoughts before, during, and after each problem solution.
Therefore the format will nearly always look like this for each problem:

* Important questions to ask about the problem before beginning
* Thought process while solving the problem
* Afterthought process when the solution is complete

## Completed Problems

1.1 Check if every character in a string is unique.

1.2 Check if two strings are permutations of each other.

1.3 Change all spaces in a string to %20

1.4 Can a palindrome be made from a permutation of a string
