    "\n",
    "###### Is the string ASCII or Unicode?\n",
    "    However, I feel that this question might could potentially open a can of worms. It is far simpler, in my opinion, to ask the interviewer if you can assume the string is ASCII.\n",

    "    Know the difference between a character-set and a character-encoding. In short, a character-set can be encoded, and often the set will have a corresponding encoding of the same name. A character-set is simply a list of characters, an encoding is how those characters are stored in memory.\n",

    "\n",

    "    \n",

    "    This is fairly simple assuming you know what a permutation is. A permutation is just a word that can be made from reorganizing another word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An example would be cat, act, tac, cta. These are all permutations of 'cat'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This means I should be able to just sort both strings, and they should then match. Keeping in mind that someone may enter UPPERCASE or lowercase, it is probably a good idea to normalize the strings.\n",
